    "This course aims to teach how to obtain valuable knowledge from a variety of online sources of information. The way to proceed is to access online resources, extract text data, and apply text analysis in order to discover interesting patterns and support decision making, with an emphasis on practical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "A strong background in text processing is necessary as information contained on online communities are generated by human beings. Therefore, it is especially valuable for discovering knowledge about people's opinions and preferences, in addition to many other kinds of knowledge that we encode in text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the interdisciplinary nature of this course, students from all backgrounds, but especially from the humanities, social science, computer science and engineering, are strongly encouraged to take this course. There are no prerequisites or antirequesites."
