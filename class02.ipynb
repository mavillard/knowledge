    "Epistemology traditionally distinguishes among three kinds of knowledge:\n",
    "- **Acquaintance knowledge** or *familiarity*. Familiarity of an entity by direct interaction (personal knowledge). For example, knowing a person or visiting a city.\n",
    "- **Propositional knowledge** or *knowing-that*. Knowledge of a fact by a declarative sentence (theoretical knowledge). For example, \"dogs are mammals\" or \"2 + 2 = 4\".\n",
    "- **Procedural knowledge** or *know-how*. Acquiring skills and abilities by doing (practical knowledge). For example, cooking a meal or riding a bike.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other possible criteria to classify knowledge:\n",
    "- By its content structure:\n",
    " - **Formal**. Expressed in a formal way. For example, logics or a programming language.\n",
    " - **Material**. Expressed in a non-formal way. For example, a report or a map.\n",
    "- By its social character:\n",
    " - **Individual**. Owned by an individual. For example, an idea or memories.\n",
    " - **Collective**. Shared by a group. For example, a lecture or the proceedings of a conference.\n",
    "- By its way of dissemination:\n",
    " - **Tacit**. Contained in the individuals' minds. For example, using a computer or playing tennis.\n",
    " - **Explicit**. Coded in a physical media. For example, the content in a book or on a hard disk."
