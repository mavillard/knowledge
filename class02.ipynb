    "\n",
    "The definition of knowledge and its role depend, at least in part, on the field in question. Below is a non-enhaustive discussion of the rol of knowledge in some of the most important areas for the human being.\n",
    "\n",
    "####Art\n",
    "Art is sometimes seen as having no relation to knowledge at all. An increasingly familiar view is that art is purely subjective: a matter of taste, unreasoned opinion, or emotional response. But is that all there is to it? What distinguishes art from non-art? Can there be a correct understanding of a work of art? If so, can an artwork be understood in isolation from other knowledge, or is it necessary some previous knowledge to grasp the work's significance? Is beauty really in the eye of the beholder? Are all interpretations of equal worth, or are some critics better qualified than others?\n",
    "\n",
    "####Humanities\n",
    "Humanists aim, through the different disciplines that compose the humanities, to understand and record the world. Knowledge of these records of human experience gives us the opportunity to feel a sense of connection to those who have come before us, as well as to our contemporaries. In a broad sense, the humanities can be described as the study of how people process and document the human experience. How do the ways in which documents are recorded influence our\n",
    "understanding of them? Does this process follow the scientific method? Are the humanities science? If so, how reliable are their knowledge?\n",
    "\n",
    "####Mathematics\n",
    "It has been suggested that the laws of nature are written into the language of mathematics. Mathematics gives certainty, but can they tell anything about the world? What exactly is the relationship between mathematics and the world? Is mathematics discovered or invented? What is a mathematical truth?\n",
    "\n",
    "####Natural sciences\n",
    "Scientific knowledge and progress is measurable in the way that it has provided success in many areas. For instance, thanks to science, humanity has developed technology, traveled in outer space, or made medicines. But how are these achievements reached? Why is science regarded as the paradigm of all knowledge? Is there a scientific method? If so, does this scientific method result in knowledge?\n",
    "\n",
    "####Social sciences\n",
    "How can human behavior be explained? Are there universal constants or laws?\n",
    "\n",
    "####Creativity and innovation\n",
    "Social networks have strongly shaped social scientific knowledge of creativity and innovation. But how do social networks and ideas influence one another? Can state of the art theory and research describe where new ideas come from? How do we recognize excellence and creativity, and strategies for generating new ideas and theories? How do copyright laws enable and constrain creativity and innovation? Is there a relation between copyright and knowledge?"

    "\n",
    "Epistemology traditionally distinguishes among three kinds of knowledge:\n",
    "- **Personal knowledge** or *familiarity*. Familiarity of an entity by direct interaction (acquaintance knowledge). For example, knowing a person or visiting a city.\n",
    "- **Propositional knowledge** or *knowing-that*. Knowledge of a fact by a declarative sentence (theoretical knowledge). For example, \"dogs are mammals\" or \"2 + 2 = 4\".\n",
    "- **Procedural knowledge** or *know-how*. Acquiring skills and abilities by doing (practical knowledge). For example, cooking a meal or riding a bike.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other possible criteria to classify knowledge:\n",
    "- By its content structure:\n",
    " - **Formal**. Defined in a formal way. For example, logics or a programming language.\n",
    " - **Material**. Expressed in a non-formal way. For example, a report or a map.\n",
    "- By its social character:\n",
    " - **Individual**. Owned by an individual. For example, an idea or memories.\n",
    " - **Collective**. Shared by a group. For example, a lecture or the proceedings of a conference.\n",
    "- By its way of dissemination:\n",
    " - **Tacit**. Contained in the individuals' minds. For example, using a computer or playing tennis.\n",
    " - **Explicit**. Coded in a physical media. For example, the content in a book or on a hard disk."
