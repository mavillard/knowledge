    "- **Employer/employee**. The employee performs a task for the employer.\n",
    "- **Teacher/apprentice**. The apprentice perform work for the teacher to acquire the skills that will enable them to do the work themselves.\n",

    "Kinds of collaboration by interaction of the collaborators' disciplines:\n",
    "- **Intradisciplinary** or **monodisciplinary**: working within one single discipline; for example, biology applied to the understanding of wild birds in Ontario.\n",
    "- **Crossdisciplinary**: viewing one discipine from the perspective of another; for example, studying the physics of music.\n",
    "- **Multidisciplinary**: adding multiple disciplines without actual interaction among them; for example, a course with guest speakers from different disciplines.\n",
    "- **Interdisciplinary**: integrating knowledge and methods from multiple disciplines to solve a specific problem; for example, a virtual assistant to practice languages that combines linguistics and computer science.\n",
    "- **Transdisciplinary**: union of disciplinary perpectives to create a new holistic discipline applicable to many situations; for example, molecular biology, which combines biochemistry with cellular biology to explain biological phenomena, or sociobiology, which applies the principles of natural selection and evolutionary biology to the study of animal social behavior.\n",
