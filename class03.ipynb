Collaboration has usually been ubiquitous in the natural and social sciences, and now more and more in other disciplines. But it was not always so, especially in the Humanities:\n",

    "- **Teacher/apprentice**. The apprentice perform work for the teacher to acquire the skills that will enable them to do the work themselves.\n",

    "- **Peer-different**. Collaborators with different background (usually researchers from different disciplines).\n",
    "\n",
    "Kinds of collaboration by interaction of the collaborators' disciplines:\n",
    "- **Intradisciplinary** or **monodisciplinary**: working within one single discipline; for example, biology applied to the understanding of wild birds in Ontario.\n",
    "- **Crossdisciplinary**: viewing one discipine from the perspective of another; for example, studying the physics of music.\n",
    "- **Multidisciplinary**: adding multiple disciplines to solve a problem from their different perspectives withouth integrating their respective solutions; for example, a course with guest speakers from different disciplines.\n",
    "- **Interdisciplinary**: integrating knowledge and methods from one discipline into another to solve a specific problem; for example, in digital humanities, a virtual assistant to practice languages that applies computer science and linguistics to a language acquisition problem.\n",
    "- **Transdisciplinary**: union of multiple disciplines that creates a new holistic discipline and covers a wider field; for example, molecular biology, which combines biochemistry with cellular biology to explain biological phenomena, or sociobiology, which applies the principles of natural selection and evolutionary biology to the study of animal social behavior.\n",

    "*Crowdsourcing* is the act of outsourcing a task to the crowd. The term was first coined in [Wired](http://www.wired.com/) by Jeff Howe in 2006. Crowdsourcing is an **online**, distributed **problem solving** and production model that leverages the collective intelligence of online communities for specific purposes set forth by a crowdsourcing organization -corporate, government, or volunteer, whose individuals perform **specific tasks**. It combines a **bottom-up, open, creative process** with **top-down organizational goals**.\n",
