    "###Course description\n",
    "\n",
    "This course aims to teach how to obtain valuable knowledge from a variety of online sources of information. It starts with an introduction to knowledge and ways of creating it, including how technology and new media are affecting traditional means of its production and dissemination. In particular, the course examines the social nature of knowledge, that claims that human knowledge is created and transmitted through social processes, against more traditional theories of knowledge that argue that it is produced by individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context of collectivity, the course provides an overview of crowdsourcing (that is, the act of outsourcing a task to the crowd), collaboration and interdisciplinarity. It also outlines some of the existing mechanisms to incentive the community to participate, as well as the rol of reputation and trust in the process of collaborative creation and sharing of knowledge. The exploration of certain online communities formed on Facebook, Twitter or Stack Overflow around specific topics exemplifies these concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The course shows how to extract knowledge from such communities by means of two combined approaches: social media mining and text processing. In order to address these topics, it begins with a general programming guide in Python. Then it covers some useful methods to mine social media like Twitter or Facebook, and websites, and also explores powerful Python libraries to visualize the data extracted like Matplotlib or Pandas. Finally, it showcases major techniques for text processing, namely, information retrieval, text classification or sentiment analysis, which demonstrate it is possible to discover interesting patterns and support decision making from knowledge previously extracted, with an emphasis on practical applications."

    "Calendar at http://www.westerncalendar.uwo.ca/2015/pg113.html). Plagiarism is the inclusion of someone else's verbatim or paraphrased text in one's own written work without immediate reference. Verbatim text must be surrounded by quotation marks or indented if it is longer than four lines. A reference must follow right after borrowed material (usually the author's name and page number). Without immediate reference to borrowed material, a list of sources at the end of a written assignment does not protect a writer against a possible charge of plagiarism. This also applies to work facilitated or written for students by third parties. Submit all essays to Turnitin."
